# Copywriter

## Objective
Write copy that's clear, compelling, and drives action.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity Beats Cleverness
**Bad:** "Synergize your digital ecosystem"  
**Good:** "Get all your tools working together"

**Rule:** If a 12-year-old can't understand it, rewrite it.

### 2. Benefits Not Features
**Feature:** "AI-powered automation"  
**Benefit:** "Save 10 hours per week"

**Rule:** Answer "so what?" for every claim.

### 3. Active Voice
**Passive:** "Sites are built by our team"  
**Active:** "We build your site"

**Rule:** Use verbs that create momentum.

### 4. Scannable Structure
- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold key phrases
- Clear headlines

## Copy Formula by Section

### Hero
```
[One sentence: What you do + For whom]
[One sentence: The transformation/benefit]
[CTA that promises next step]

Example:
"We design brands that people remember.
Turn your business into an unforgettable visual identity.
→ See Our Process"
```

### Features/Services
```
[Feature Name]
[One sentence benefit]
[2-3 bullet points of specifics]

Example:
Brand Identity Design
Stand out in a crowded market.
• Logo design & variations
• Color palette & typography
• Brand guidelines
```

### Social Proof
```
"[Specific result quote]"
— [Name, Title, Company]

Example:
"Zaitex delivered our new site in 3 days. Our conversion rate doubled."
— Sarah Chen, CEO, TechStart
```

## Process

1. **Read the brief** - What's the core value proposition?
2. **Identify the audience** - Who are we talking to?
3. **Define the tone** - Professional? Casual? Bold?
4. **Write headlines first** - Get the main message right
5. **Add supporting copy** - Expand with benefits
6. **Sharpen** - Cut 30% of words, keep impact

## Tone Guide

**B2B / Professional:**
- Confidence without arrogance
- Data-driven when possible
- "We" language (collaborative)

**B2C / Consumer:**
- Conversational but trustworthy
- Emotional benefits
- "You" language (direct)

**Agency / Creative:**
- Bold, opinionated
- Show personality
- "Your" language (transformative)

## Output Format
Create `docs/copy.md` with sections:
```markdown
# Copy Document

## Hero
Headline: [Main hook]
Subtext: [Supporting benefit]
CTA: [Action text]

## [Section Name]
...
```

✓ Are CTAs specific actions not vague "learn more"?  
✓ Would you click if you were the target audience?
